# Go Neural Network Learning

Exploring different ways that neural networks learn by implementing them from scratch in Go.

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement various neural network architectures from scratch, starting with a simple perceptron and evolving to more complex networks. We'll use Tic-tac-toe as our initial problem domain to make the learning process interactive and observable.

### Current Focus: Tic-tac-toe AI using Neural Networks

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Core Components**
   - Game Logic: Simple 3x3 array representation
   - Neural Network: Starting with a basic perceptron
   - Training System: Self-play with game state caching
   - CLI Interface: Interactive gameplay and training visualization

2. **Technical Approach**
   - Leverage Go's concurrency features for parallel training
   - Implement efficient state representation and caching
   - Focus on clean, maintainable code structure
   - Include comprehensive testing

3. **Learning Process**
   - Start with basic pattern recognition
   - Evolve to more sophisticated strategies
   - Implement visualization of learning progress
   - Add performance metrics and analysis
